# laglessplusquakerockets-tfc

This is an amxx mod plugin that makes rockets lagless. It cancels out the ping delay of up to 130 milliseconds, so they feel like you're on a LAN.

The quake rockets are going to allow you to shoot rockets Quake 3-style, so they will be pixel accurate at any distance. Default TFC rockets are angular and hard to place at a distance. Not something conducive to fast accurate gameplay.
